/**
 * This library can create responses for SASL authentication for a given
 * challenge and a given secret. This way of authentication is common for
 * SMTP, POP3, IMAP and LDAP.
 *
 * SASL is one way strong encryption and therefore useful for authentication,
 * but not for secret information transfer.
 * It is possibly to prove with SASL to know a shared secret like a password.
 * It is not possible with SASL to transfer any other information in an
 * encrypted way. For that purpose OpenPGP or SSL are useful.
 *
 * Currently PLAIN (RFC 2595), LOGIN, CRAM-MD5 (RFC 2195) and
 * DIGEST-MD5 (RFC 2831) authentication are supported.
 * PLAIN and LOGIN do only use encoding and not encryption.
