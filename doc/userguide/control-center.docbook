<para>The &kcontrolcenter; is the place to go to change any settings that
affect the whole of your &kde; environment. You can open it using the
<guimenuitem>Control Center</guimenuitem> item in the &kmenu;, or with its
command-line name, <filename>kcontrol</filename>.</para>

<para>The settings are divided into several major categories, which each
contain several pages of settings. To display a settings page, expand the
major category by clicking on the <guilabel>+</guilabel> button next to it,
and then click on the name of the page you want. The settings page then
appears on the right, and you can change settings to your heart's
content. No changes take effect until you click on the
<guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button. If you decide, after making some
changes, that you want to leave the settings as they were, just click on
<guibutton>Reset</guibutton>.</para>

<para>If you need more help with a page, visit that page, then click on the
<guilabel>Help</guilabel> tab. You might also want to look at the

the KDE Wallet Manager. All of them will ask at least once for permission to
access to actual wallet. You can give different access levels, such as "always
