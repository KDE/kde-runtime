<title>Window Specific Settings</title>

<para>Here you can constomize window settings specifically only for
some windows.</para>

<note>
<para>Please note that this configuration will not take effect if you
do not use &kwin; as your window manager. If you do use a different
window manager, please refer to its documentation for how to customize
window behavior.</para>
</note>

<para>Many of the settings you can configure here are those you can
configure on a global basis in the <guilabel>Window Behavior</guilabel>
&kcontrol; module, however some of them are even more detailed.</para>

<para>They encompass geometry, placement, whether a window should be
kept above or below others, focus stealing prevention, and translucency
settings.</para>

<para>You can access this module in two ways: from the titlebar of the
application you wish to configure, or from &kcontrol;.  If you
start it from within &kcontrol; you can use the
<guibutton>New...</guibutton> to create a window profile, and the
<guibutton>Detect</guibutton> button on the resulting dialog to
partially fill in the required information for the application
you wish to configure.</para>

<para>You can also at any time <guibutton>Modify...</guibutton> or
<guibutton>Delete</guibutton> any stored settings profile, and
reorder the list.  Reordering the list is a convenience to help you sort
the profiles, and has no effect on how they are applied.</para>
