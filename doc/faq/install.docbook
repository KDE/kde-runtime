<question>
<para>To the would-be converts</para>
</question>
<answer>

<para>So you have heard the rumors. Or you have seen the screenshots.
And you are dying to get hold of &kde;.  But you know next to nothing
about this whole <quote>alternative OS</quote> business.  Don't worry!
You only need to do some (well, maybe not some) reading, that's
all!</para>

<para>&kde; does not run on any version of &Microsoft; &Windows; or OS/2 (yet).  To run
&kde;, you need to have a &UNIX; system. Please refer to <xref
linkend="platform"/> for more details.</para>

<para>Decide on a platform and set it up for your system. This
<acronym>FAQ</acronym> can not help you with this, since &kde;<ulink
url="http://www.kde.org"> runs on many &UNIX;</ulink> platforms. </para>

<!-- Taken out because we can not help with all platforms and KDEisnotLINUX -->

<para>Finally, you are ready to commence the &kde; installation.
Please start reading from the next section.  To get &kde;, please
refer to <xref linkend="where-to-get-kde"/>.  Last but not least, if
you encounter any problems while installing &kde;, please do not
hesitate to make use of the &kde; <link 
linkend="mailing-lists">mailing lists</link> and <link
linkend="newsgroups">newsgroups</link>.  But do bear this in mind: no
question is too silly to ask, but some are too silly to answer,
especially when they are already answered in this <acronym>FAQ</acronym>.</para>

<question>
<para>What kind of hardware do I need to run &kde; ?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>To run &kde; it is recommended that you have at least a pentium II processor, 64MB of memory and 500MB of free disk space for a basic installation. While &kde; may run on slower configurations than this, performance can be severely impaired. Generally, if your computer runs an &X-Server; already with other desktop environments or window managers it's probably fast enough to run &kde;.</para>

<para>Available package formats</para>
</question>
<answer>


<para>You can find several kinds of binary and source packages for
different distributions and operating systems on the &kde-ftp;.  The
binary packages are not made by the &kde; Team, but by the
distributors themselves, or some dedicated individuals. Please refer to
<ulink url="http://dot.kde.org/986933826/">&kde; Package Policy
Explained</ulink> for information about the &kde; Package Policy. The
only <quote>official</quote> release is the source tar.bz2
packages. Please refer to the <filename>README</filename>s and
<filename>INSTALL</filename>s in the several binaries folders. For
a list of the available packages for a release, refer to the relevant
info page. For the latest release this is the <ulink

<answer>

<!-- rewrite to make it more general, pointing to the according webpages? -->

<para>For &kde; 3.4.1, you need the &Qt; library version 3.3 or greater.  
Please make sure you download the correct &Qt;.  You will
also need the header files, if you want to compile &kde;
yourself.  They are all available, at no cost, from <ulink
url="http://www.trolltech.com/products/download">http://www.trolltech.com/download</ulink>.
In addition, there are optional libraries that might improve &kde; if
installed on your system.  An example is OpenSSL which will enable
&konqueror; to browse web pages securely and is needed in a version
>=0.9.6.  These should be provided by your distributor; if not, ask
for an update.</para>

<question>
<para>Post-installation procedures</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>First of all, please make sure that you have added &kde;'s binary
installation folder (&eg; <filename
class="directory">/usr/local/kde/bin</filename>) to your <envar>PATH</envar>
and &kde;'s 
library installation folder to your <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> (only
necessary on systems that do not support rpath; on &Linux; &ELF;, it 
should work without).  This environment variable may be called
differently on some systems, &eg; it is called
<envar>SHLIB_PATH</envar> on &IRIX;.  Then set the environment variable
<envar>KDEDIR</envar> to the base of your &kde; tree, &eg; <filename
class="directory">/usr/local/kde</filename>.
<caution>
<para>Please bear in mind that it is unwise to set
<envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> blindly.  In the vast majority of cases it is
unnecessary and can do more harm than good.  There is a web page
written by <ulink url="mailto:barr@cis.ohio-state.edu">Dave
Barr</ulink> explaining the evils of <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> and it can be
found at <ulink
url="http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html">http://www.visi.com/~barr/ldpath.html</ulink>.</para>
</caution>
</para>
<para>Even though you can use most of the &kde; applications simply by
calling them, you can only benefit fully from &kde;'s advanced
features if you use the &kde; window manager and its helper
programs.</para>
<para>In order to make it easy for you, we have provided a simple
script called <filename>startkde</filename> which gets installed in <filename
class="directory">$<envar>KDEDIR</envar>/bin</filename> and is therefore in your
path.</para>
<para>Edit the file <filename>.xinitrc</filename> in your home folder (make a backup
copy first!), remove everything that looks like calling a window
manager, and insert <command>startkde</command> instead.  Restart the &X-Server;.  If you use
&kdm;/<application>xdm</application>, you will have to edit the file <filename>.xsession</filename> instead of
<filename>.xinitrc</filename>.  And if there is no <filename>.xinitrc</filename> or <filename>.xsession</filename> in your home
folder, simply create a new one with just one line containing
<command>startkde</command>.
<note>
<para>Some systems (notably &RedHat; &Linux;) use <filename>.Xclients</filename>
instead.</para>
</note></para>
<para>This should present you with a new shining &kde; desktop.  You
can now start to explore the wonderful world of &kde;.  In case you
want to read some documentation first, there is a highly recommended 
<ulink

<question>
<para>I upgraded &kde; and it seemed to go fine, but when I start it,
I get a blank gray screen, and nothing happens.  There are errors in
the console about DCOPserver.  What's going on?</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
&kde; uses several temporary files during its operation.
These are usually to be found in the following locations:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><filename>~/.DCOPserver-*</filename> (there are usually two of these; one is a symlink to the other)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>~/.kde/socket-<replaceable>hostname</replaceable></filename></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>~/.kde/tmp-<replaceable>hostname</replaceable></filename> which is normally a symlink to the next file:</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>/tmp/tmp-kde-<replaceable>USER</replaceable></filename></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>~/.kde/socket-<replaceable>hostname</replaceable></filename> which is also normally a symlink to:</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>/tmp/ksocket-<replaceable>USER</replaceable></filename></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>If the symlinks get broken, usually because a
<command>cron</command> or shutdown script is emptying out the
<filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> folder, then strange
things will happen.  These files, and the symlinks, will all be
created automatically at the start of &kde; so you can safely remove
them <emphasis>while &kde; is not running</emphasis>.</para>

<para>If you are only getting a gray screen when you start &kde;, or if you get an error message telling you to <errorname>Check your installation</errorname>, then shut down X and delete all the files listed above, then try to restart X.</para>

<para>Normally (&ie; when not upgrading between &kde; versions) it's
quite safe to leave these files intact, and you may shave a few
seconds off your &kde; startup time by doing so.</para>

<question>
<para>How do I uninstall &kde; applications compiled from
source?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>You can uninstall your programs by typing <command>make
uninstall</command> in the folder where you did <command>make
install</command>.  If you have already deleted that folder,
then there is only one way, and it is not good: go to <filename
class="directory">$<envar>KDEDIR</envar>/bin</filename> and start deleting files
one by one.</para>
<para>If you expect to find yourself in this situation, you might want to
consider a program such as &GNU; <application>stow</application>, found at
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html</ulink>.</para>
