Before 3.2 release
_________________________________________________

- Split up the monolith docbook             (done)
- Get rid of 1.1.2 stuff (confusion)
- check if things are still working
  * compile tutorials for the various OS's
  * workarounds still needed?
  * workarounds still working?
  * answers are still valid?
  * easier solutions?
- complete revision ?
- New structure ?
- Find maintiners for single parts
- what needs to be added ?

[22:15:47] <lauri> 1: move the faq (and other kdebase docs) up to kdebase/doc/<subdir> 
so that docs.kde.org will pick them up and generate them
[22:16:05] <lauri> then remove the copies on www.kde.org, put in redirects to the new 
location, and have one, autogenerated and searchable copy all the time
[22:16:17] <physos> sounds nice
[22:16:24] <physos> will look into it
