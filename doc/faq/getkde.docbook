<question id="where-to-get-kde">
<para>Where do I get &kde;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<!-- This needs a rewrite including informations about the latest version (link to the info page?)-->
<para>The main distribution site for &kde; is 
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/">ftp.kde.org</ulink>. However, this site is
often under heavy load, so you might prefer to use 
<ulink url="http://download.kde.org/">download.kde.org</ulink> which automatically
redirects you to the mirror nearest to you.
You can also have a look at the list of <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/ftpmirrors.html"> &kde; mirror sites</ulink>.</para>

<question>
<para> Are there &Linux; distributions that include &kde;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>Yes, major &Linux; distributions already ship &kde;.  As
building a distribution takes some time, they might not always contain
the latest version, but for a start or to avoid downloading from the
Internet, they do provide a good starting point.
</para>
<para>You can find an up-to-date list of distributions that ship
with &kde; <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/download/distributions.php">here</ulink>.
