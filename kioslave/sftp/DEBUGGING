DEBUGGING

Debugging this kio_slave is a little bit more difficult than normal.
When ssh runs it checks to see if a tty is available. If one is, it 
asks for the password on the tty, otherwise it uses askpass.
One can get debug messages by restarting kdeinit in a shell. This
will cause problems for ssh, since it will find a tty and will ask
for the password on the tty. This will result in ssh getting a bunch
of bogus data for your password.
Instead you must send debug info to a file using 'kdebugDialog --fullmode'.
Then you can 'tail -f' the file to see debug messages in real-time.

I also suggest getting the openssh and recompiling sftp-server to send messages
to the auth log.  This can be done in sftp-server.c be defining DEBUG_SFTP_SERVER.

You can do the same with ssh by finding the two calls to log_init() in ssh.c
and changing the last argument from 1 to 0 and recompiling.
