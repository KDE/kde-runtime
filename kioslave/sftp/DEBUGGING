DEBUGGING

The best way to debug this slave is to send debug info to a
file using 'kdebugDialog --fullmode'. Then you can 'tail -f' the file to 
see debug messages in real-time.

I also suggest getting the openssh source and recompiling sftp-server to 
send messages to the auth log.  This can be done in sftp-server.c be defining
DEBUG_SFTP_SERVER.

You can do the same with the ssh client by finding the two calls to log_init() 
in ssh.c and changing the last argument from 1 to 0 and recompiling.
