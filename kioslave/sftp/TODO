- store passwords per user/host pair, not per connection
  (multiple users per host work now, but when switching views one has to
   re-enter the login info every single time)
- support for different ports (sftp://user@host:port), this can be done by
  adding the argument -oPort=7022 (or whatever port) to sftp, could not get
  it to work properly though
- bug: when changing hostname in locationbar, password dialog pops up at
  every change even without pressing enter
