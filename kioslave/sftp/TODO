TODO:
- Notify the user when a new host key is received.
- Warn the user when the host key changes.
- Add support for other versions of OpenSSH and SSH.
- Support for use of public keys, maybe ssh-agent, a key management app, etc.
- store passwords per user/host pair, not per connection
  (multiple users per host work now, but when switching views one has to
   re-enter the login info every single time)
  - Done! This was a problem with caching in the ioslave base class and
    has been fixed.

- do not move items to trash when deleting (probably a generic kio_slave
  problem, though, makes no sense to download everything you want to delete)
  - Done! Fixing in konqueror

- support for different ports (sftp://user@host:port), this can be done by
  adding the argument -oPort=7022 (or whatever port) to sftp, could not get
  it to work properly though

- bug: when changing hostname in locationbar, password dialog pops up at
  every change even without pressing enter
  - Bug report submitted to konqueror

- bug: kio_sftp crashes KDE completely when one or more of konq, kio and
  kio_sftp are compiled with the objprelink patches. None of the other
  kioslaves do this for me, but it also happened when I recompiled kio_sftp
  without the preloading, so I'm unsure whether it's a kio_sftp or kio or
  konq bug. Will investigate some more. (Rob)
