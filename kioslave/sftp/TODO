TODO:
- Password caching doesn't work. We get a new dialog box every time a new kio_sftp process starts.
  Very annoying.
  
- Support for use of public keys, maybe ssh-agent, a key management app, etc.

- bug: when changing hostname in locationbar, password dialog pops up at
  every change even without pressing enter
  - Bug report submitted to konqueror

- bug: kio_sftp crashes KDE completely when one or more of konq, kio and
  kio_sftp are compiled with the objprelink patches. None of the other
  kioslaves do this for me, but it also happened when I recompiled kio_sftp
  without the preloading, so I'm unsure whether it's a kio_sftp or kio or
  konq bug. Will investigate some more. (Rob)

COMPLETED
=========

- Orphaned ssh processes are bad. Shame on me. - Done 
  Use SIGKILL to kill the ssh process. The ssh client seems to catch 
  SIGTERM from its parent and ignore them.

- Continuing partial upload - doesn't create .part file.d
  fixed I think, but I am unable to test resume. kio denies my resume request - Done
  
- When typing sftp url into konqi, konqi tries to connect before we finish
  typing url. Konqi is trying to do directory completion, but we don't 
  want this when connecting to a remote server the first time. kio_ftp
  doesn't do this...why? - Done
  
- When a connection gets canceled we are leaving ssh processes behind - Done

- Notify the user when a new host key is received. - Done

- Warn the user when the host key changes. - Done

- Add support for other versions of OpenSSH and SSH. - Done

- Store passwords per user/host pair, not per connection
  (multiple users per host work now, but when switching views one has to
   re-enter the login info every single time) - Done! This was a problem with 
   caching in the ioslave base class and has been fixed.

- Do not move items to trash when deleting (probably a generic kio_slave
  problem, though, makes no sense to download everything you want to delete)
  - Done! Fixing in konqueror

- Support for different ports (sftp://user@host:port), this can be done by
  adding the argument -oPort=7022 (or whatever port) to sftp, could not get
  it to work properly though - Done
