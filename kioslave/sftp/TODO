TODO:
- Notify the user when a new host key is received.
- Warn the user when the host key changes.
- Add support for other versions of OpenSSH and SSH.
- Support for use of public keys, maybe ssh-agent, a key management app, etc.
- store passwords per user/host pair, not per connection
  (multiple users per host work now, but when switching views one has to
   re-enter the login info every single time)
  - Done! This was a problem with caching in the ioslave base class and
    has been fixed.

- do not move items to trash when deleting (probably a generic kio_slave
  problem, though, makes no sense to download everything you want to delete)
  - Done! Fixing in konqueror

- support for different ports (sftp://user@host:port), this can be done by
  adding the argument -oPort=7022 (or whatever port) to sftp, could not get
  it to work properly though

- bug: when changing hostname in locationbar, password dialog pops up at
  every change even without pressing enter
  - Bug report submitted to konqueror
