Just a few more questions/answers.
Read the README file if you didn't do it already.


***********************
Is it related to Samba?
***********************

Yes, but also no. The library has been written independantly from Samba, and
the native code can run without Samba present on the system.
However, it is strongly recommended to install Samba-TNG and compile this
library to use it, as you'll have much better results.


************
Limitations.
************

Native Code:
Nothing's perfect, and certainly not this library. First of all, the SMB
protocol itself isn't perfect. Usually, this library works fine for LANs.
However, as soon as the SMB network spans several subnets, problems appear
(even in the presence of a WINS server, supported and necessary in this case).
It is not possible to do domain logons though it is possible to log on a each
server that requires it.
Encryption is implemented for the protocol versions we use (according to the
specifications...), some servers still refuse access or send unknown packets.
There are also bugs, inevitably.

Samba mode:
It can more or less do what smbclient does. Anything related to SMB in Samba
mode is done in the Samba libraries, so refer to Samba in that case.
The library cannot do domain logons.


************************
Is there a mailing-list?
************************

The mailing list and cvs server have moved to SourceForge.
See http://www.sourceforge.net for more information, and the project home page.


**************************
When will 1.0 be released?
**************************

When we have time! And anyway not before Samba-3.0 is out.


***********************
How can I report a bug?
***********************

You can report a missing feature or a bug by sending a mail to the mailing list
describing your problem. If possible, try to use the CVS version first to see if
it's not there already. Alternatively, you can complain directly to me or any
author.


***********************************************
Personal Note (Well, I know, it's not a FAQ...)
***********************************************

I'm no longer on an LAN and don't use SMB anymore. The protocol changes
constantly, and I certainly cannot/will not maintain the native code.
Moreover, I'm bored of doing SMB and would like to move on to more interesting
projects.
Don't worry though, I'll try to maintain the link with Samba as their API is
quite stable and it's quite fun to do a project like this, and hopefully more
people will come to help.
