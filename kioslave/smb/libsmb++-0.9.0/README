This version of libsmb++ is used by kio_smb exclusively. This doesn't mean the
library has suddenly become non-free, see http://libsmb.sourceforge.net for
a full implementation. It just means that no header and doc will be installed
in kde paths, so only kio_smb have access to it.
If another KDE program does really not want to use kio_smb but the libsmb++
directly, and justify the need, then we'll reconsider putting this lib elsewhere.
Otherwise, the recommended way is to use kio_smb.
