HOWTO get the libsmbclient built, so that you can get the new smb ioslave built...


1. Check out the samba sources from cvs with ( full directions are at: http://www.samba.org/samba/cvs.html
   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot login
   use "cvs" as the password
   cvs -z5 -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot co samba/source
   (since samba 2.2.2 it is included)
2. cd samba/source
3. run "./configure --with-libsmbclient"
4. run "make bin/libsmbclient.so" (or "make && make install" for all)
5. when compiling is done- shouldn't take more than 5-15 minutes depending on your machine,
   you need to install the header file and the library.
   I use:
   cp bin/libsmbclient.so /usr/lib/.
   cp include/libsmbclient.h /usr/include/.
