HOWTO get the libsmbclient built, so that you can get the new smb ioslave built...

1. Check out the samba sources from cvs with ( full directions are at: http://www.samba.org/samba/cvs.html
   cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot login
   use "cvs" as the password
   cvs -z5 -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot co -r SAMBA_3_0 samba/source
2. cd samba/source
3. sh autogen.sh
4. run ./configure && make
5. when compiling is done- shouldn't take more than 5-15 minutes depending on your machine,
   you need to "make installclientlib installdat" - if you want all of samba, do "make install"
