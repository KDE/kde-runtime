This is the first release of my KDE 2.0 kioslave
for the IMAP protocol.

It supports LOGIN, AUTHENTICATE LOGIN and
AUTHENTICATE CRAM-MD5.
It supports the rfc2192 URL naming convention.

- UIDVALIDITY is not checked
- realtive URL's are not supported because
  konqueror will not handle them
- search is not yet included
- there are 2 additional section keywords
  ENVELOPE will do a FETCH ENVELOPE
  STRUCTURE will do a FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE
  normal behaviour is FETCH BODY.PEEK[section]
  
- the mime types delivered are not really consistent
  with the returned data
  - it will return inode/directory on list entries
    which contain inferiors
  - it will return message/digest on selectable mailboxes
    with file type S_IFDIR
  - type message/rfc822-imap on selected messages
	and type S_IFREG
	
- as I couldn't get into debugging any other way
  the qDebug output is redirected into a hardcoded
  file /tmp/imap_slave
  
To compile you need the kde-common package out of the
cvs repository. Link kde-common/admin into the directory
where you unpacked the kioslave. Do a make -f Makefile.cvs
and then the usual configure, make, make install.

In Konqueror set the mimetype message/rfc822-imap to use
the inline viewer.

Try it:  imap://user@host/
         imap://user;AUTH=*@host/
		 imap://user;AUTH=LOGIN@host/
		 imap://user;AUTH=CRAM-MD5@host/
