************ IMPORTANT **************

The imap slave has been moved to kdepim/kioslaves/imap4
(and temporarily renamed to kio_newimap, associated with the newimap protocol).

This one (kdebase/kioslave/imap4) stays only for compatibility reasons.
Please do NOT make any commits to it, it's going to be removed after kdepim-3.3 is out.
