DESIGN
======
kio_trash implements the XDG trash standard currently at http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html

In case race conditions between the various instances of kio_trash
are a problem, trashimpl could be moved to a kded module, and
kio_trash would use DCOP to talk to it. It's a bit hard to come up
with use cases where the race conditions would matter though.

BUGS
====
* $topdir partitions should store relative paths in the trashinfo files!

TODO
====
* Show original path and date of deletion. In properties dialog? In tooltip? In listview column?

* Detect removeable media to avoid .Trash-foo on it. How?

* Trashcan properties (properties for trash:/? hmm. Easier with separate dialog)
     -  Maximum size for trash can (18109 suggest a %, but a MB size is easier).

* Option to delete old files from the trash automatically. #79553
  Combine with the code that auto-deletes the oldest file when trashcan is too full

* Err, should we support renaming? :) Difficult to disable...
  In fact it's already not disabled in readonly directories (e.g. "/") -> todo

Choice of URL scheme
====================
We use trash:/trashid-fileid[/relativepath]    
This gave problems with CopyJob::startRenameJob which exposed trashid-fileid
to the user as a filename when dropping a file out of the trash.
But this was fixed with the fileNameUsedForCopying=Name setting.

A previous experiment was trash:/filename[/relativepath]?t=trashid&id=fileid
but this gives problems with going Up (it first removes the query),
with KDirLister (it wouldn't know when to remove the query, to find the URL
of the parent directory).
