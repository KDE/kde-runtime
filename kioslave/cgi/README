The CGI IO slave provides a way to execute CGI programs without the need to
have a running web server. This can for example be used for local testing of
CGI programs or for using search engines that only provide a CGI frontend like
the one from Doxygen.

The IO slave implements the cgi: protocol. It uses the filename from the given
URL and searches a configurable list of directories. If it finds an executable
with the given name it executes it, passes the arguments of the URL and sets the
environment variables needed by CGI programs.

The kcontrol module System/kcmcgi is used to configure the search paths for CGI
programs.
