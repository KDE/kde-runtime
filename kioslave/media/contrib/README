Those scripts are an example on how to allow media:/ to use
hotplugging events if you don't use HAL. They're targeting
"Linux 2.6 + hotplug + udev" platforms, but we can surely make
something equivalent for Linux 2.4, FreeBSD...

They are just examples, the packagers will surely develop their
own version (I'm currently using them on Debian Sid, Linux 2.6.9
though).

1) mediamanager_usbstorage.dev
This file only needs to be copied to /etc/dev.d/default

2) usbcam
This one is a bit more complicated to install.
The file must be copied into /etc/hotplug/usb and the file
/etc/hotplug/usb/usbcam.usermap must exists (you can use
libgphoto2's print-usb-usermap command to create it)
