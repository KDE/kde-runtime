/**
 * A dummy archive interface used by our test cases.
 *
 * It reads a JSON file which defines the contents of the archive.
 * For the file format description, see the documentation for @c JSONParser.
 *
 * The file's content is read to memory when open() is called and the archive
 * is then closed. This means that this class never changes the file's content
 * on disk, and entry addition or deletion do not change the original file.
