/**
 * Simple parser which reads JSON files and creates @c ArchiveEntry objects
 * from it.
 *
 * The JSON file is expected to follow a specific format that describes an
 * archive read by Kerfuffle.
 *
 * The format consists of a list of dictionaries whose keys are values from the
 * EntryMetaDataType enum.  The only required key for each entry is FileName;
 * other values which are omitted for each entry are assumed to be 0 or false.
 *
 * Example file:
 * @code
 * [
 *     { "FileName": "foo", "IsPasswordProtected": true },
 *     { "FileName": "aDir/", "IsDirectory": true }
 * ]
 * @endcode
