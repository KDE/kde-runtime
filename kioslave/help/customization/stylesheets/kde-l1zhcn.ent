<!-- Notes for translators:
 1. Do not translate `&...;' (unless you know the mechanism).
 2. In the strings ("..."), only use characters allowed by the SGML
    declaration (i.e. no ASCII values >127).  To encode such
    characters, write them as ISO entities (e.g. &oacute;), slashed
    ISO names (e.g. \latin-small-letter-o-with-acute;), or \U-XXXX
    where X is an upper case hexadecimal, and XXXX is the Unicode
    value for the character (e.g. \U-00F3).
    Let us know should you know of other encodings that work.

    Conversion to Unicode was done using the GB2312.TXT mapping from
    the Unicode ftp server (may be not correct).
    Byte1*16^2+Byte2-0x8080=GB2312 code, this is looked up in conversion
