FIXMEs:
	Amazingly, none that I can think of

grep TODO kio_mac.cpp
        //TODO this means dev=foo must be the last argument in the query
        //TODO this error interrupts the user when typing ?dev=foo on each letter of foo
        //TODO are there any more characters to escape?
        QString theSize(fileRE.group(4)); //TODO: this is data size, what about  resource size?

Future things:
	- maybe make it work with plain old hfs partitions
	- possibly use libhfsp directly
        - A Friend suggested reading the resource data for the icon to display - advanced I think.
 	- Follow symlinks/aliases (requires reading the resource fork as well)
