lots of stuff:

-uid, gid, permissions for creation, symlink checking and creation, error checking
-cache handling: how long should file handles be cached ?
	should the stat'ed structures be cached ? no, IMHO
-honour the overwrite and resume flags
-do I have to destroy the clnt_tcp_creat()ed CLIENT ?
-the encodeFileName()-stuff
-yet more stuff
