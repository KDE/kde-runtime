networkkio
==========

This is an experimental kioslave which presents the network.
It also includes a library which models the network, the devices, and services,
and could be reused by other code.

Please contact the author Friedrich W. H. Kossebau <kossebau@kde.org> for any further questions.
Cooperation in this area is welcome :)


ioslave
-------
The ioslave lists the local network as represented by the
The protocol name is "network", so enter "network:/" to see your local network.
Currently, due to synchronisation problems, the network data is fetched from the
kded network module via D-Bus, instead of using the network library directly.


kded
----
A kded module to emit KDirNotify signals as needed if the network structure changes.

That way all users of the network kioslave and listening to KDirNotify can update the view,
e.g. Dolphin, Konqueror and the KDElibs file dialogs.
It also offers the data of the network structure over D-Bus, as currently used by the ioslave.


network
-------
A library which models the network with all its devices and the services offered by them.

Currently it uses KDNSSD, the KDElibs interface to the zeroconf service discovery system,
as the engine to find about the content of network structure. Later on this library should
support different backends concurrently (also SLP, UPnP, Windows related stuff like smb,
including undiscoverable/hidden but user/admin entered ones).
If this works out this library might end in KDElibs solid module.
