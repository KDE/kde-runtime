copytester is a test case for the fish kioslave. It copies 100 files from /tmp to /tmp/test using fish's functions.
It was written to verify KDE bug 147948: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147948

To run it, do the following:
mkdir /tmp/test
for i in $(seq 1 1 100); do touch /tmp/fishtest${i}.txt; done
cmake . && make -j4 && rm /tmp/test/*; ./copytester

Then, to run it again and again, do:
rm /tmp/test/*; ./copytester

If the program is successful (i.e. the bug does not exist) it will terminate, otherwise, run infinitely.
