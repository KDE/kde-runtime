L resume (could be very slow in shell mode due to WRITE being slow)
L other remote shells (rlogin, telnet) - difficult, would need a shell prompt detector which is impossible to get 100% accurate. Contributions welcome.
L show host list when called as fish://
L plug into sidebar, show directory tree there
M employ locking to only show one password dialog, so that loading many files at once from the same host would use a cahced password instead of opening tons of dialog boxes
M more meaningful error messages (need perl server first)
H use rsync or a similar technique (if possible at all)
M proxying via intermediate ssh account
H make it work with charsets other than latin1
