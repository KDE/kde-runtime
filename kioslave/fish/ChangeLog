1.2.1 by Willy De la Court <willy.delacourt@pandora.be>
	implemented su for fish://localhost/
	fish://root@localhost/ will su to root

	fish://localhost:22/ will still use ssh

1.2 by Willy De la Court <willy.delacourt@pandora.be>
	implementation of the EXEC function
	made sure all the VER lines where the same
	used eval and system() for executing the command
	Send the VER command directly after the FISH command.
	After using kill to close the child process used wait to really make sure the child
	has died. If the child took some time to die the select()
	returns "Interrupted system call" error. This should solve some hanging problems.
	added hasExec so it can be tested.
	backport to BRANCH sendCommand(FISH_VER); and wait(NULL) to fix potential bugs.
