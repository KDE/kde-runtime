Freqeuently Asked Questions, last updated for kio_fish 1.1

Q: Typing fish:/some.host.com does not work
A: It is fish://some.host.com (double slash)

Q: How can I use a different port?
A: Use regular URL syntax: fish://some.host.com:2222

Q: Something isn't working. I get strange/no displays
A: Could be a bug, could be a problem with the remote
   tools. Try having perl somewhere in the PATH on the
   remote machine, that should work reliably. Shell-
   only mode is prone to different tool's opinion about
   parameters and what they mean. Shell-only mode is
   thouroughly tested only on GNU tools, and has
   superficial testing on BSD and Digital Unix. Solaris
   seems to have problems. Any reports for shell mode on
   non-GNU machines welcome (BTW, if you see a file
   .fishsrv.pl in your remote home directory, fish did
   use perl mode)
   
Q: The connection stays open. How do I disconnect?
A: Just wait. The system default idle timeout is used.
   (about a minute or so)
   
Q: Why are there no icons?
A: With this release, you should have icons almost always,
   but best results are obtained if you install a recent
   version of the 'file' utility that supports the '-i'
   option.

Q: How do I specify which program to use for SSH?
A: Not at all, sorry. After evaluating other programs (rsh,
   rlogin, telnet) I came to the conclusion it was way too
   complex to support these, as only ssh supports both,
   password authentication and automatic execution.
