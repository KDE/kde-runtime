GENERAL
=======

In KDE we support localization of calendars, dates, time, numbers and
money. KDE will use this when displaying such information, giving you
a feeling that KDE was written to fit your national standards. To make
this possible, we need to gather some information on your national
standards. Currently there are some 237 countries supported. If your
country is missing, please let us know.

The official ISO codes unsupported as at 18/11/2008 are:

    * AQ Antarctica
    * BV Bouvet Island
    * GS South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands
    * HM Heard Island and MacDonald Islands
    * IO British Indian Ocean Territory
    * SJ Svalbard and Jan Mayen
    * TF French Southern Territories
    * UM United States Minor Outlying Islands

Of these, the following codes are likely to be considered for support:

    * SJ Svalbard and Jan Mayen

The other codes are unlikely to be considered due to lack of population.

HOW TO ADD INFORMATION
======================
First you have to write a file called "entry.desktop". This file will
describe your national standards. Please read the section below for
more information on that. Please use the file "country.template" as
template.

You will need a nice flag for your country. The size should be 21x14
pixels, and it should be called "flag.png".

To add your information, we need a two letter country code for you country.
Use http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/ or the entities.csv document in
this folder as a guide.

Now you are done, and you can submit the files to KDE project by adding a wish
item on bugs.kde.org under Product kdelibs Componant KLocale. The files will be
added in the next release.

WHAT IS ENTRY.DESKTOP
=====================
entry.desktop is a file which defines a locale for a country. It's
stored the same way as the rest of the KDE configuration files. The
very first line should only contain "[KCM Locale]". The rest of the
file should contain one line for each of the entries below. Add "="
between the entry name and the value.
