GENERAL
=======
In KDE 2 we added support for localization of dates, time, numbers and
money. KDE will use this when displaying such information, giving you
a feeling that KDE was written to fit your national standards. To make
this possible, we need to gather some information on your national
standards. Currently there is over 220 countries supported. If your
country is missing, please let us know.

HOW TO ADD INFORMATION
======================
First you have to write a file called "entry.desktop". This file will
describe your national standards. Please read the section below for
more information on that. Please use the file "country.template" as
template.

You will need a nice flag for your country. The size should be 21x14
pixels, and it should be called "flag.png".

To add your information, we need a two letter country code for you country.
Use http://www.tu-berlin.de/zrz/dienste/netz/mail/iso-3166.html as a guide.

Now you are done, and you can submit the files to KDE project by
sending a mail to Hans Petter Bieker <bieker@kde.org>. The files will
be added in the next release. Please include the country code in the
mail.

WHAT IS ENTRY.DESKTOP
=====================
entry.desktop is a file which defines a locale for a country. It's
stored the same way as the rest of the KDE configuration files. The
very first line should only contain "[KCM Locale]". The rest of the
file should contain one line for each of the entries below. Add "="
between the entry name and the value.

        middleeast (Middle-East/West Asia)
