/**
 * A check box is a component that can be switched on (checked) or off
 * (unchecked). Check boxes are typically used to represent features in an
 * application that can be enabled or disabled without affecting others, but
 * different types of behavior can be implemented. When a check box is checked
 * or unchecked it sends a clicked signal for the application to handle.
 *
 * When a check box has the focus, its state can be toggled using the
 * Qt.Key_Select, Qt.Key_Return, and Qt.Key_Enter hardware keys that send the
 * clicked signal.
 *
 * All properties of this component are defined in DualStateButton, its base component.
