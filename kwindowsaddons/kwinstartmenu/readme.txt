This package provides support for creating windows start menu entries for KDE applications 
either by using a standalone application named kwinstartmenu or by using a KDED module 
(kded_winstartmenu) which runs in the background and creates/updates the start menu entries 
on any ksycoca database change. 

The executable and the KDED module retrieves menu entries from the ksycoca database including 
internationalized menu categories and entries. Application icon in the menus is also supported. 

Requirements: kdelibs-4.x
