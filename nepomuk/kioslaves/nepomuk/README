The Nepomuk KIO slave
=====================

This KIO slave is used to handle all Nepomuk resources which use 
the new (KDE 4.4) URI scheme nepomuk:/. This includes file resources. 
The slave will handle the following cases:

1. Nepomuk resources that refer to local files
The KIO slave will forward all operations to the file:/ KIO slave.

2. Nepomuk resources that refer to local folders
The KIO slave will forward all operations to the file:/ KIO slave.
In addition UDS_URL will be set to the local URL so that the
slave does not need to recurse into subfolders. This is only done
for simplicity.

3. Nepomuk resources that are of type nao:Tag
These will be listed as folders containing all resources tagged with
that specific tag. This is achieved by redirecting all operations
to the nepomuksearch:/ KIO slave. A redirect is used instead of a
forward in order to never show nepomuk:/ URLs in the GUI.

4. Nepomuk resources that are of type nfo:Filesystem
These will be listed as folders if the corresponding removable
device is mounted. As with tags a redirect is used to prevent
showing the nepomuk:/ URL in the GUI.

5. Nepomuk resources that refer to files on removable devices
These will be forwarded to the file:/ KIO slave in case the device
is mounted (the get operation will even mount an available but
unmounted device). In case the device is not mounted a virtual
entry is created showing the file as being available on another 
device.

6. Nepomuk resources that refer to folders on removable devices
Handled like files on removable devices. In addition UDS_URL will
be set to the local URL so that the slave does not need to recurse 
into subfolders. This is the same procedure as with local folders.

7. Any other unrelated Nepomuk resource
General resources will be listed as virtual entries and get will 
return an HTML page which shows its properties and relations.


The KIO slave heavily depends on UDS_DISPLAY_NAME since it will
put the resource's URI into UDS_NAME. This is the same procedure
the nepomuksearch:/ KIO slave uses to solve the problem with
duplicate names in query results.
UDS_LOCAL_PATH will be set whenever possible.
