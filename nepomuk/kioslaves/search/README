A search ioslave that is intended to list search results in a folder structure which
can be configured, maybe through a query parameter (categorize by).
The idea is that apps use this protocol but never show the url to the user since it will
look weird.

nepomuksearch:/<thequerystring>

This should allow something like the search on MAC.

The plain nepomuksearch:/ URL could provide some actions for:
- predefined searches (like on mac)
- create a new search -> starts a little dialog which writes a new default search into
  some config file
- last searches
