/**
 * Filter model that performs automatic conversion of file URLs
 * from and to the filex:/ protocol.
 *
 * The basic idea is that all resources representing files on removable media
 * do have a nie:url with schema filex:/<UUID>/<relative-path> where <UUID>
 * is the UUID of the removable media and <relative-path> is the path of the
 * file on the medium. This is necessary since different media might be mounted
 * at the same mount point which could lead to clashing URLs.
 *
 * In theory all file URLs could be stored this way. However, to improve performance
 * this conversion is only done for files on removable media.
 *
 * The following conversions are performed to provide a handling
 * of files on removable media that is as transparent as possible:
 *
 * \li file:/ URLs used in all statement commands and queries are converted to
 * the corresponding filex:/ URL if necessary.
 * \li filex:/ URLs referring to existing files (on a medium currently mounted)
 * are converted to file:/ URLs in query and listStatement results.
 * \li filex:/ URLs referring to non-existing files (on a medium currently not
 * mounted) will not be converted (since it is not possible).
 *
 * Thus, whenever clients see a filex:/ URL they can be sure that it refers to
 * a file that is not accessible at that time and act accordingly (show a message
 * box, hide the query results, etc.).
