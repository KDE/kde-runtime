    /**
     * The CrappyInferencer is based on work by Gunnar Grimnes and Leo Sauermann
     * for the Nepomuk project.
     *
     * As they state, the CrappyInferencer(TM), it is unsound, incomplete and at times
     * completely crazy. It only covers 3 cases:
     *
     * \li Inverse Properties: (x, p1, y) => (y, p2, x) - where ( p1, nrl:inverseProperty, p2 )
     * \li ABox Subclass Inference: (x, rdfs:subClass, y) => (x, rdfs:subClass, z)
     * for all z that is super-classes of y
     * \li ABox SubProperty Inference: (x, rdfs:subProperty, y) => (x, rdfs:subProperty, z)
     * for all z that is super-properties of y
     *
     * The full RDFS entailments are described in
     * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#RDFSRules"> RDFS entailment rules</a>.
     *
     * For subclass and subproperty relations, the self-referencing relation is
     * added when the UU type rdfs:Class is added.
     *
     * Note that for inverseProperty the order of insertion is important, i.e. when
     * adding a new (a, inverseProperty, b), existing triples using a or b will not
     * be updated. Yes, this makes it wrong and inconsistent. I might fix this
     * later.
     *
     * \section crappy_queries Queries
     *
     * No type inference is performed for queries, so to get "inference" you have to
     * query for rdfs:subClassOf relationship. For example, imagine you want all
     * instance of MyClass (and all it's subclasses), you need this query:
     *
     * \code
     * SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x a ?t . ?t rdfs:subClassOf prefix:MyClass }
     * \endcode
     *
     * If you really need to know the direct subClass of something, you need to rely
     * on the context information using a query like the following (see also crappyInferenceContext()):
     *
     * \code
     * SELECT ?x WHERE { GRAPH ?g { ?x rdfs:subClassOf prefix:MyClass . } .
     *                   FILTER(?g != <urn:crappyinference:inferredtriples>) . }
     * \endcode
     *
     * \section crappy_deleting Deleting Triples
     *
     * \li Deleting a triple with a predicate that has an inverse will also delete
     * the inverse triple.
     * \li Deleting subClassOf, subPropertyOf or nrl:inverseProperty triples will
     * <strong>NOT</strong> attempt to "fix" the triples already inferred from
     * this. Only future insertions will be correct. Yes this means it will be
     * inconsistent and wrong. I said it was crappy. I will not fix this. For
     * instance, if (A subclass B), (B subclass C) is in the store and (B subclass
     * C) is deleted, I will still think A is a subClass of C.
