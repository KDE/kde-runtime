##Brainstorming
--------------

#IDEAS for installdbgsymbols.sh ? (to show progress in DrKonqi UI)
* Catch output and show status messages (ex "echo 1" , show "packages found"...)
* Catch all the output and show in a textedit (like a readonly terminal)
* Embed a Konsole KPart

- Display the time of the crashed
(oh, I came back to the computer some time later and drkonqi was there.. 
when the application crashed? during the night?) (by sreich)

- Usability review and suggestions:

- Hide backtrace from user (only show progress and backtrace status)??

- Search in backtrace (esp. for [KCrash Handler])
- Backtrace syntax highlighting (xml parser+ some qt/kde class ?)

##Other tasks
-------------

- Dialogs -> Non-modal
    
- Option to "don't show drkonqi for this(X) app"
- Option to avoid drkonqi at all (setting KDE_DEBUG=1), and GUI to renable it

- Improve DuplicatesPage dialog: what if you want to pick more than one possibly duplicate?

- Option to Attach the new crash information to an existing report (check username and backtraces?
to avoid mixed reports)

- Ask for saving the report information to file when exiting the report assistant without reporting
( This is going to be done with the Drkonqi2.1 proposal to not close the main dialog on report)
Leave the main dialog on launching the reporting tool, but add some legends:
 "Reporting tool started for this crash"
 "You reported this crash already" (and remove the , "help KDE, report bug" messages)

- Custom usefulness values needed by application (ex. Amarok wants only perfect backtraces...)

- Check for plugins ? (example, if plasma crashes, which libs were loaded, which lib caused the crash)
This is useful to determine if some external plugin is involved
(I don't know if this is technically possible)
(cat /proc/PID/maps)

- Read and upload as attachment (cat /proc/PID/maps), memmap

- Application detection: ask for or detect specific things depending on application
   ie konqueror: url, plasma: plasmoids in use, kopete: protocal, etc.

#ToDiscuss/Improve
--------

- REVIEW criteria of minimum chars/words to use in the Title and Details fields 
(drkonqiassistantpages_bugzilla.cpp:729)

#Later
---------

- waiting for productName()->product/component mapping (custom cgi file at BKO)
[[ currently bugzillalib detects unexistent products to later use the "kde" product ]]
Update: local mappings file support already implemented.

#DONE
-------
