    gkiagia: Fix backtraceinfo logic (backtrace parsing to get its usefulness)
        
##Unassigned
-------------

fix crashed app getting lost/close, so the backtrace isn't generated and the duplicates page crash on invalid firstValidFunctions()
detect if the pid isn't set (?) 

fix awarenesspage layout

add warns about we want text in english !! (partly done)

Finish "about bug reporting steps" (guide)  (documentation format ?)

Check leaks, crashes

krazy2 checks (partially done)

check what all the options in KrashConf are meant to do and use them appropriately or drop them (i.e review options)

//fix kwallet... ? use konqueror bko logic LATER

#Done
---------

#Extract interfaces to .UI files
    #getbacktracewidget

Add Translation i18n (with contexts) . change HTML tags (are they invalid when using i18n???)

#Rework Bug awareness text
// const pointers ? LATER
//Use KGUIItem to create KPushButton
//Set help for gui items, whats this,
#better logic to determine if the bug was commited (better html parsing?) DONE using regexp

change "report to maintainer" to "send email to maintainer" / "open maintainer web page"

Enable help button on assistant ?
### merge crashinfo  + krashconf ?? LATER

#busy cursor -> progressbar 
#"busy" progressbar for getbacktracewidgets
# kio progressbar for bugzilla related operations (only for post operations.. login and commit )
( using StatusWidget for status + busy state )


way to get graphical feedback of KToolInvocation:invokeMailer

extract methods from crashInfo to SystemInfo (?) (like getOS, getKDE .. )

#implement save report
#QNetworkAccessManager -> KIO

#KWallet integration
#Relayout getBacktraceWidget buttons/labels , layouts

#Each page widget should emit setNextButton() on aboutToShow() (when needed by the widget)
#Remember to connect the setNextButton signal

#Discuss , when to launch the kWallet dialog..........
( currently, if the wallet doesn't exist, it prompts to create it when the login 
information is entered the first time. If the wallet exists, it prompts for password when
showing the login page, and it allows autocomplete the data )

#Add reporting steps to assistant
