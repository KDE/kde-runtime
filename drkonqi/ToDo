#Assigned

##Unassigned
-------------
    
- Dialogs -> Non-modal

- Store "willing to help developers" for future DrKonqi usages?

- Option to "don't show drkonqi for this(X) app"
- Option to avoid drkonqi at all (setting KDE_DEBUG=1), and GUI to renable it

- We need a new icon/image :)

- Improve DuplicatesPage dialog: what if you want to pick more than one possibly duplicate? 

- Ask for saving the report information to file when exiting the report assistant without reporting

- Application detection: ask for or detect specific things depending on application
   ie konqueror: url, plasma: plasmoids in use, kopete: protocal, etc.

#ToDiscuss/Improve
--------

- BugzillaKeywordsPage word filtering (and minimum length) criteria 
(drkonqiassistantpages_bugzilla.cpp:257)
(( check at least X words, with Y of them with a minimum of Z chars ..? ))
    currently 50 for subject and 100 for body; we'll see how that works

- REVIEW criteria of minimum chars/words to use in the Title and Details fields 
(drkonqiassistantpages_bugzilla.cpp:729)

#Later
---------

- Better kwallet integration: use what konqueror uses when you login?
   some method of keeping you logged in to bz to avoid a few dialogs
- Bugzilla searches should be on product name +"kde" +(?kdelibs?)
- Recheck KDevelop integration (currently it seems disabled on KDevelop side)

- waiting for productName()->product/component mapping (custom cgi file at BKO)
[[ currently bugzillalib detects unexistent products to later use the "kde" product ]] [LATER]

#DONE
-------

- Side by side backtrace comparison on "Show report information" (duplicates step)
- WordWrap aboutbugreporting
- Removed Qt::escape calls
- Avoid LSB messages at all if no found
