##Unassigned

merge crashinfo  + krashconf ??

//add warns about we want text in english !!
    Partially done 

detect if the pid isn't set (?) 

better logic to determine if the bug was commited (better html parsing?)

Rework Bug awareness text
Finish "about bug reporting steps" (guide)

Check leaks, crashes

//Use KGUIItem to create KPushButton
//Set help for gui items, whats this,

Enable help button on assistant ?

krazy2 checks (partially done)

const pointers ?

check what all the options in KrashConf are meant to do and use them appropriately or drop them (i.e review options)

#Done

#KWallet integration
#Relayout getBacktraceWidget buttons/labels , layouts

#Each page widget should emit setNextButton() on aboutToShow() (when needed by the widget)
#Remember to connect the setNextButton signal

#Discuss , when to launch the kWallet dialog..........
( currently, if the wallet doesn't exist, it prompts to create it when the login 
information is entered the first time. If the wallet exists, it prompts for password when
showing the login page, and it allows autocomplete the data )
