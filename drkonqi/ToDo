##Brainstorming
--------------

- Display the time of the crash
("I came back to the computer some time later and drkonqi was there.. 
when the application crashed? during the night?") (by sreich)

- Usability review and suggestions:
http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/01/54734.aspx (by Maciej)

- Hide backtrace from user (only show progress and backtrace status)??

- Search in backtrace (esp. for [KCrash Handler])
- Backtrace syntax highlighting (xml parser+ some qt/kde class ?)

- Option to "don't show DrKonqi for this(X) app"
- Option to avoid drkonqi at all (setting KDE_DEBUG=1), and GUI to renable it


##Other tasks
-------------

- Check string (native english) in the new features.

- Update "AboutBugReporting" guide to reflect the new workflow

- Ask for saving the report information to file when exiting the report assistant without reporting
( This is going to be done with the Drkonqi2.1 proposal to not close the main dialog on report)
Leave the main dialog on launching the reporting tool, but add some legends:
 "Reporting tool started for this crash"
 "You reported this crash already" (and remove the , "help KDE, report bug" messages)
->>>> THis may need a major UI rework...

- Custom usefulness values needed by application (ex. Amarok wants only perfect backtraces...)

- Check for plugins ? (example, if plasma crashes, which libs were loaded, which lib caused the crash)
This is useful to determine if some external plugin is involved
(I don't know if this is technically possible)
(cat /proc/PID/maps)
- Read and upload as attachment (cat /proc/PID/maps), memmap

- Application detection: ask for or detect specific things depending on application
   ie konqueror: url, plasma: plasmoids in use, kopete: protocol, etc.

- Implement TerminalDebuggerLauncher (the idea is to use the same trick as the one used in the installdbgsymbols.sh examples)

- BacktraceGenerator should not be allowed to start if another debugger is running.
  Add some check and possibly some signal indicating this state. As a consequence,
  remove the call to DrKonqi::debuggerManager()->debuggerIsRunning() from BacktraceWidget
  to make it trully independent from drkonqi.

- Make a docs dir and add documentation for:
  1) the format of the debugger files
  2) The dbus interface
  + move README.packagers in there with a proper name.
  
- Register dynamic debug area (see dfaure's mail on k-c-d).

#Later
---------

- Waiting for productName()->product/component mapping (custom cgi file at BKO)
[[ currently bugzillalib detects unexistent products to later use the "kde" product ]]
Update: local mappings file support already implemented.

- REVIEW criteria of minimum chars/words to use in the Title and Details fields

- Implement a proper dbus interface.

#DONE
-------

#- Improve DuplicatesPage dialog: what if you want to pick more than one possibly duplicate?
#   - Improve UI of the new feature implementation
#- Option to Attach the new crash information to an existing report (check username and backtraces?
to avoid mixed reports)
#   - Implement a UI

* Crashes on Shutdown:

https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126073 ->
**** Restore block shutdown/logout while DrKonqi window is up
(to catch crashes on shutdown)
- Config option to:
  - (default) Show a feedback indicator for a "automatically closing window" timer (and continue with shutdown)
  - non-default Block shutdown/logout completely, do not use a closing timer.

- Ask Seli for Session Management stuff (we need to ask from code if we are in the middle of a shutdown process)
- Use " unsetenv("SESSION_MANAGER");" again on main.cpp  (http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/kdebase/drkonqi/main.cpp?r1=408177&r2=408176&pathrev=408177)

- Startkde waiting for drkonqi to exit->
     # wait if there's any crashhandler shown

319              sleep 5
