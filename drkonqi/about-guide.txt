-- Information about bug reporting --

You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
Note: It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. ( Also, You may need to install some packages )

-- Bug Reporting Assistant Steps Guide --

This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process of the Bug Reports Database Site of KDE

- Crash Information -

This page will generate the trace of the crash. This information is really useful to know where and why the application crashed.
If the crash information isn't useful enought, you may need to install some packages and reload it. You can find more information about the traces of a crash on http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Debugging/How_to_create_useful_crash_reports

Once you get an useful trace (or if you don't want to install the missing packages) you can continue.

- What do you know about the crash -

In this page you need to answer some questions about the crash context and your will to help the developers in the future if it's needed.
If you can describe the crash context (the details of what were you doing when the application crashed: you can mention: Documents that you were using (or its type/format), actions you were taking in the application and the whole system, web sites you were browsing, another strange things you notices after of before the crash, and so on.

- Conclusions -

Using the usefulness of the crash information gathered previously , and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting, and the application is supported in the KDE Bug Report Database, you can click next. However if it's not supported you will need to contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is not worth reporting, you can still manually report the bug if you really want to.

- KDE Bugtracker Login -

As we may need to contact you in the future to ask further information and we need to keep record of the bug reports, you need to have a bugs.kde.org account. If you don't have one, you can freely create it here: http://bugs.kde.org/createaccount.cgi
Then you can write your username and password and press the Login button. Once you are autenticated, you can press Next to continue.

The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password on loading to autocomplete the data if you use this assistant again,.

- Bug Report Keywords -

In this step you need to write at least four(4) words to identify the crash. You can use the application name, or write a little sentence about the crash or the context. This text will be used to search similar crashes already reported in the database, so you can look at them later. Also, this text can be used as the title of the future bug report (you can change this later)

- Bug Report Possible Duplicate list -

This is an optional step
This page will search at the bug report database for similar crashes (possible duplicates). If there are some bug report found, you can double click on them to show their details. Then, reading the current bug report information you can check if the situations were similar and you can tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report.
If the listed possible duplicates aren't enought (or you didn't found a similar report) you can force the search of more bug reports (only if the date range is not reached)
Don't worry if you can't find a similar bug report or you don't know what to look at. The bug report database maintainers will look at it later

- Details of the Bug report -

In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash context. Explain the best you can.

- Send Crash Report -

This page will send the bug report to the database and it will notify you when it's done. Then you have the URL of the bug report in the KDE database to look at it.
If the process failed, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report Again.
