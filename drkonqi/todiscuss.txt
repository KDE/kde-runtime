Discussions:
-----------

- Texts needs review/rewrite (TODO tag..)

- Layouting of the Main/Advanced widget on the First dialog
(( Need to discuss if use separate widgets on a QStackedWidget with the Toggle button,
or use the old approach: basic info is always show, backtracewidget visibility can be toggled ))

- BugzillaKeywordsPage word filtering (and minimum length) criteria (drkonqiassistantpages_bugzilla.cpp:269)
(( check at least X words, with Y of them with a minimum of Z chars ..? ))

- Rewrite text (drkonqiassistantpages_bugzilla.cpp:716)

- Rewire criteria of minimum chars/words to use in the Title and Details fields  (drkonqiassistantpages_bugzilla.cpp:690)

#DONE

- The "needToReport" estimation logic: (drkonqiassistantpages_base.cpp:235)
Always true if the backtrace is perfect.. or we still require the details ?
[[ From pinotree approach, even with a perfect backtrace we still need some context about the crash to consider it useful ]]
Use pino approach

- Layouting of the bug awareness page (now that we merged the "I can reproduce" option with the "details" one )
(( This should be simple as we removed and cutted some texts ))
It's OK the current one
